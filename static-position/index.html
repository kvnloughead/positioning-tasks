    <title>Static Position (the default)</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Below we have a series of HTML elements all of which have the default
      `position` value of `static`.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note how the &lt;div&gt;s are all placed vertically, one after another,
      but the &lt;button&gt;s are placed horizontally. This is how these
      elements are placed according to the default document flow. This default
      placement can be altered by the `position` property, as you'll soon see.
      But there are other ways to effect an items placement that you've already
      encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add some styles to the `button` class to make the buttons render
      vertically. There are multiple solutions, but try to do it with a single
      CSS property.

        class will work.</span
