              Absolute position works a bit differently then relative position.
              First off, if you give an element
              <b>position: absolute</b> it will be pulled out of the normal
              document flow. Let's try that out here on the child elements.
            </p>
            <p class="challenge__text">
              First, apply
              <b>position: absolute</b> to the first child element and note what
              happens. Then scroll down to the next section.

        <div class="grandparent">
          <div class="parent">
            <div class="child child_pos_first">Child 1</div>
            <div class="child child_pos_second">Child 2</div>
          </div>

            <p class="challenge__text">
              When we applied
              <b>position: absolute</b> to the first child, the second child
              disappeared! That is probably not what you expected. Can you
              figure out why it happened? This is a great chance to use the
              elements tab.

                the option to temporarily delete it from the DOM.</span

        <div class="grandparent">
          <div class="parent">
            <div class="child child_pos_first">Child 1</div>
            <div class="child child_pos_second">Child 2</div>

      <div class="challenge">

          <div>
            <p class="challenge__text">
              If you looked through the element inspector you would have found
              that the second child didn't disappear at all — it moved to the
              top of its parent container, and was obscured by the first child.
              This is what happens when you apply
              <b>position: absolute</b> to an element: it stays where it is, but
              it's neighbors act as if it wasn't there.
            </p>
            <p class="challenge__text">
              Like with relative position, when an element is absolutely
              positioned you can use
              <b>top</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>bottom</b> and <b>left</b> properties
              to adjust its position. But there's a difference. Instead of
              shifting their position with respect to
              <span class="challenge__emphatic-text">itself</span>, you shift it
              with respect to its closest positioned ancestor.
            </p>
            <p class="challenge__text">
              Wow, what does
              <span class="challenge__emphatic-text">
                closest positioned ancestor
              </span>
              mean? We'll explain that in the next lesson.
