              Think back to when we were shifting elements with
              <b>position: relative</b>. We had you move them as shown to the
              right. You may have felt that getting it just right was a bit
              cumbersome. For instance, at a glance it is definitely not
              immediately apparent what dimension you need to use to shift the
              blue container over to the left edge of its parent. You have to
              use trial and error.
            </p>
            <p class="challenge__text">
              Using absolute position in these cases can greatly simplify
              things, because with absolute position the element can be
              re-positioned relative to one of its parent containers, instead of
              relative to itself.
            </p>
            <p class="challenge__text">
              But there's still one more issue to consider before we can
              position the blue container with respect to its immediate parent.
              Try adding <b>position: absolute</b> and <b>top: 0</b> to the blue
              container, and see what happens.

              As soon as we apply <b>top: 0</b> the parent element jumps to the
              top of the page! Why would that be? Well, recall that phrase from
              the previous lesson — "closest positioned ancestor". An ancestor
              is positioned if it has a non-default position, so the immediate
              parent of the blue container is not positioned.
            </p>
            <p class="challenge__text">
              When this happens, the browser checks the next containing element
              to see if it's positioned, and so on. If you use devtools to check
              each successive parent element of the blue box you'll note that
              none of its ancestors are positioned. When this happens, the
              container will be positioned with respect the the browser window.

              You finally have enough information to use absolute position to
              reposition the elements as shown to the right. Make it so! A
              solution is given below.

          Answer
          <span class="hint__text"
            >First, we need to give the grandparent element a non-default
            position. We'll use <b>position: relative</b> for this, since it
            won't produce any unwanted side effects. Then we can position the
            blue container absolutely and give it <b>left: 0</b>. We can omit
            <b>top: 0</b>, since it is implied by default.</span
          >
          <span class="hint__text"
            >We can position the first child absolutely by giving it a negative
            <b>top</b> value equal to its height. The second child can be
            positioned with <b>bottom: 0</b> and <b>right: 0</b></span
          >
          <span class="hint__text"
            >Note that for the first child, it isn't any easier for us to
            position the element absolutely compared to doing so relatively.
            Each have their places.</span
