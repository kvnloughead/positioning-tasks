            Did you noticed that when you moved the first child, the position of
            the second child stays the same? This is how `position: relative`
            works. Initially, the element is placed according to the normal
            document flow, so neighboring elements respect its borders. But if
            you shift its position using `top`, `right`, and so on, other
            elements behave as if it hadn't moved at all. Use this fact to shift
            the second child as shown to the right.
          </p>

          <!-- Answer: add position: relative; top: -120px; right: 60px; to child 2 -->
          <!-- or some other reasonable combination -->
